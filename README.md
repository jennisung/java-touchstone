Deciding where to eat for breakfast/lunch/dinner is a dilemma people often face. Typically, someone would consider things like their current budget, time constraints, ingredients on-hand, and how tired a person is, to help make their decision. The problem solve is to help users in quickly making this decision, by creating this interactive quiz. For this quiz, users will first enter the names of three types of restaurants/places to eat, each corresponding to a budget type (low-budget, medium-budget, high-budget). Low budget would be a home cooked meal, medium budget would be a fast-food restaurant, and high-budget would be going out to eat at the restaurant. The user is then asked to rate specific factors, such as budget constraints, time availability, ingredients on-hand, and how tired a person is. These ratings will be tallied up to a total score, which the program will then use to suggest a good place to eat. The output of this program is a recommendation for where the user should eat. This will help in providing the user with a personalized recommendation for their restaurant decision.
